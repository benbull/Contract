# Rad support Ltd. contract

This is the standard contract to which I—acting as Rad Support Ltd.—operate.
This contract can be amended and updated to be tailored to individual clients
and projects, this is merely my boilerplate.

## Big Thanks

This contract is a forke of https://github.com/csswizardry/Contract by Harry Roberts.  Thank you Harry for showing the world that contracts don't need to be full of hidden clauses, tricks and legalese.
